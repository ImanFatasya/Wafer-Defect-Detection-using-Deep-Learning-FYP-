# Wafer-Defect-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-FYP-
This Project analyzes semiconductor defect detection on wafer maps using deep learning. The semiconductor industry faces significant challenges in maintaining high production yields and quality, primarily due to the complexity of defect detection processes. This research aims to develop an automated classification system that leverages deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to identify and classify various types of wafer defects effectively.

Utilizing the WM-811K dataset, which encompasses over 800,000 wafer map images, this study addresses the limitations of traditional manual inspection methods that often yield inconsistent results and are time-consuming. The research explores several CNN architectures, including MobileNet-v2, GoogleNet, and DenseNet121, to evaluate their performance in accurately classifying defects such as center, donut, edge-loc, and others.

The findings indicate that deep learning models, particularly those employing data augmentation and advanced preprocessing techniques, significantly enhance classification accuracy compared to manual methods. Additionally, a prototype for a web-based defect detection system is developed, demonstrating the practical applicability of the research outcomes. This work not only contributes to the advancement of automated defect detection in semiconductor manufacturing but also aligns with sustainable development goals by promoting efficiency and reducing waste in production processes.
